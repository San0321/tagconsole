# Rank Tag

This Script allows to parse Tag ID along with the ranking (popularity). 

## Getting Started

* It would parse from the **second tab** in the excel file.

* To Run this, ```MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-uri" node rank-tag your-excel-file-name```

* It is replacing a document in the MongoDB, so you should change ObjectId if the database changes.
