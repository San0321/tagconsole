# Rank Tag

This Script allows to parse Tag ID along with the ranking (popularity). 

## Getting Started

* The Name of the excel file **must** be "tempfile.xlsx".

* It would parse from the **second tab** in the excel file.

* To Run this, ```MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-uri" node rank-tag```

* It is replacing a document in the MongoDB, so you should change ObjectId if the database changes.
